          </p>
          <p>Iâ€™m based in Melbourne, Victoria. I discovered web development after creating a Python game, and I instantly fell in love with it. In my free time, I enjoy staying active, reading, and playing competitive games. After completing this exciting course, the long term goal would be to break into the software-engineering world and bring my wildest ideas to life.</p>
